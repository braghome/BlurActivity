# BlurActivity
small improvement on the original workmanager codelab from google.

This would not be possible without a majority of source material from [google codelab](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-workmanager) and improvements [commonware](https://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware)

I just changed a few bits on google's codelab to get rid of a depricated save image call.
